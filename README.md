Quickstart:

1. Checkout docker3 branch
2. Change ALLOWED_HOSTS in HelpMap/settings.py to desired hostname
3. (Add map/config/keys.py and declare OPENCAGE_API_KEY with you opencage api key)
4. "docker-compose up"

This automatically creates an admin account with password "password" as well as test categories and test help points, so make sure to change these values.
